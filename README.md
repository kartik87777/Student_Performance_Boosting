# Student_Performance_Boosting
This analysis approach is for the students taking education at two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por).

For the purpose of analysis, I have classified students into three categories, "good", "fair", and "poor", according to their final exam performance. Then I analyzed a few features that have significant influence on students' final performance, including Romantic Status, Alcohol Consumption for both weekdays and weekends, Frequency Of Going Out. Finally, leveraging avaiable features, I have created various machine learning models to predict students' final performance classification and have compared models performance based on one-out sample accuracy score.
